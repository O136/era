The project was compiled and tested on a 4.15.0 x86_64 GNU/Linux Kernel

Dependencies:
  nasm version >= 2.13.02
  gcc version  >= 7.3.0
  make

Project Structure:
        makefile
        readme

        headers
          polynom.h
          utils.h
        src
          main.c
          norm.asm
          polynom.c
          utils.c
        test
          test.c
          polynom.txt

test.c      contains useful testcases to test the
            correctness of the norm function.

utils.h     contains helper functions to print out the polynomes.

norm.asm    contains the assembly implementation of the norm function defined
            in polynom.h.

polynom.txt is just a C implementation that can be used to understand the
            norm.asm better.

If the dependencies are fulfilled then we can proceed to compile
the project with the help of the make utility and makefile.

COMPILATION:

There are 3 possible make targets : all, test, clean.
They can be invoked with the commands from the console:

make all
make test
make clean
